When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I care about a more secure backup or when I want to share with others 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To be able to controll what is exactly pulled from the repository. There are can be some cheanges intraduced by other people who might 
work on the same project. So before merging any changes in my project I would like to see and to approve those changes instead of having 
Git automatically update my local repository.
